Open - SIngle decision. If the shop is closed then there is no sales. No need to include this feature in training. 

1) All the fields present in the training data are not present in the test data. Most importantly there is a filed called customers in the training data. This cannot be present in the test data since one cannot know the number of customers prior to a particular date. Hence sales can be forecasted either by forecasting customers and then using it or sales can be forecasted directly by ignoring the customers field. It is our discretion. 

2) The prediction variable is a continuous variable and hence we need to use regression techniques to estimate the data. As per internet references many regression techniques such as GBRT, SVR, AdaBoosting all works well in these kind of problem settings. But given the time complexity and system configurations these pose as a tough problem to us.
